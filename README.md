# Working-Portfolio

My portfolio. Very much like the original portfolio from the first week of class, but with some additions and changes:

<ul>
  <li>A ‘Resources’ page with some links and a to-do list for myself</li>
  <li>A hamburger menu I built rather than drawn from Bootstrap</li>
  <li>A ‘splash’ page (in spite of the fact that so many people seem to hate them)</li>
  <li>A CSS grid experimentation/example page that you can change via js triggered by button clicks</li>
</ul>
  
  More to come. Stay tuned...
